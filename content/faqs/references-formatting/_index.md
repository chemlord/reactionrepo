Here you can find answers to very Referencing and Formatting questions. For more specific topics, please explore our FReferences and Formatting section for your topic.

## Referencing

{{% details title="What citation style do you use for your references?" closed="true" %}}

We use the American Chemical Society (ACS) citation style for our references. This style is widely recognized and commonly used in chemistry and related fields, ensuring consistency and clarity in our citations. For more detailed information, you can refer to the official ACS Style Guide.

{{% details title="How do I access the papers you referenced for your examples?" closed="true" %}}

Click on the footnote to be directed to the specific reference. Alternatively, you can click on the reaction diagram to view the associated paper.

## Formatting

{{% details title="Why are there no step numbers included in the reaction diagrams to indicate its location on the paper's reaction pathway?" closed="true" %}}

We provide step numbers from the original paper in the "Where did the reaction come from?" sections but omit them in tutorials for simplicity and clarity.

To enhance learning, especially for beginners, we exclude step numbers to avoid confusion and maintain clarity, similar to textbook practices. We focus on essential details like reagents, conditions, and yields to prevent information overload and make key points accessible. Detailed descriptions are provided in the "Where did this Reaction come from" section under every question for comprehensive understanding without cluttering diagrams.

{{% details title="Why is the yield percentage included in some reaction schemes/questions?" closed="true" %}}

Including the yield percentage directly in the diagram (usually below the product) provides immediate insight into the efficiency of the reaction, which is a critical aspect of chemical synthesis. This information is valuable for understanding the practical outcomes of the reactions and aligns with common practices in academic publications.

{{% details title="How do you handle complex multi-step reactions in the papers?" closed="true" %}}

We isolate and illustrate the key step in the synthesis where the specific reaction occurs, as described in the paper. Rather than detailing the entire synthesis, we focus on the critical transformation relevant to the article's topic. This approach ensures clarity and allows readers to concentrate on the important reaction without being overwhelmed by the full synthetic pathway.

Our goal is to provide a clear and concise educational resource for learners at all levels. Feedback is welcome to help improve the clarity and educational value of our content.

{{% details title="Why does Reaction Repo use 'R' only instead of 'R¹', 'R²', etc., for some entries?" closed="true" %}}

Reaction Repo uses 'R' only when there is a single substituent involved in the reaction. This simplifies notation, ensuring clarity and generalization, as it indicates that any alkyl or aryl group can be present without specifying different substituents.
