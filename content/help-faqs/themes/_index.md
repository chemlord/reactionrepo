## Theme Additions

{{% details title="Will more Themes be added?" %}}

Yes, we plan to add more variations to our light and dark themes in the future. This will include variations in colours and accents of text, boxes, etc. However, it will take some time as we are currently focused on ensuring a high-quality user interface and comprehensive content for our site. We appreciate your patience and support as we work towards these enhancements.

If you have any suggestions for themes and colourways please [contact us](https://cat-bounce.com/)
