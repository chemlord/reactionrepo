## Overview

Chemist.swiswiswift is Japanese reaction database and was translated into English for international usage. It has become a good tool for chemistry students and professionals. The site features detailed mechanisms of hundreds of organic chemistry reactions, mirroring content from a mobile database app with over 500 downloads. This site fascinated me, as seemingly, no one had claimed credit nor provided any information as to where or who procured the information for content this rich and detailed.

## Website Content and Features

- **Extensive Reaction Database**: The site includes hundreds of organic chemistry reactions, each with detailed mechanisms.
- **Practice Questions**: While not abundant, some reactions are accompanied by practice questions to enhance learning.
- **Recent Updates**: Although the site was created in 2016, most updates occurred in 2021 according to the Wayback Machine. The latest updates indicate ongoing maintenance and content addition.

### Mobile App
The site is a ported version of an organic chemistry mobile database app, which has been downloaded over 500 times. The app serves as a portable reference for students and professionals, featuring the same high-quality content found on the website.

### Site Drawbacks

- **No Theme Switching**: The site does not offer a light mode, which may not suit all users.
- **Outdated HTML Design**: The design is rudimentary and lacks modern web development features.
- **Lack of Organization and Referencing**: The content, though accurate, is not well-organized and lacks proper referencing, which could impact the user experience and content reliability.
- **Hard to See**: Some colours used in the mechanisms to indicate side chains or certain bonds of the molecules were very difficult to see.
