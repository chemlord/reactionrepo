While the mystery surrounding the author adds an intriguing element, our intention is purely to offer thanks and recognition.

## Content and Features

The siteâ€™s content is exceptional, featuring:

- **Hundreds of Organic Chemistry Reactions**: Each reaction is accompanied by clear, step-by-step mechanisms.
- **Practice Questions**: Some reactions include practice questions, though these are sparse.
- **Simple HTML with Hugo and JS**: The site employs a basic HTML structure powered by the Hugo framework and includes JavaScript for loading animations.

### Site Design and Technology

- **Hugo Theme Inkblotty**: The website uses the Inkblotty theme, which provides a clean and minimalist layout ideal for displaying chemical reactions. The theme can be found at github.com/takoikatakotako/swiswiswift.com.
- **No Theme Switching**: The site does not offer a light mode, which may not suit all users.
- **Outdated HTML Design**: The design is rudimentary and lacks modern web development features.
