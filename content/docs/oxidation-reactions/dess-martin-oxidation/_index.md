## Dess-Martin Periodinane

<p>Periodinane 2, also known as Dess-Martin Periodinane (DMP), was originally derived from 2-iodobenzoic acid and exhibited remarkable efficiency and selectivity. It was reported that DMP was soluble in other solvents such as in hexane or ether were deemed sparingly soluble. Additionally, it was deemed very soluble in dichloromethane, chloroform and acetonitrile. Dichloromethane (DCM) was reported as the primary solvent used as stated by Dess & Martin (1983).<a href="#fn1" id="ref1-anchor" class="superscript">1</a></p>

    link="https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jo00170a070">}}

### Reagent Preparation

<p>The preparation of Dess-Martin Periodinane (DMP) involves two key steps. First, 2-iodobenzoic acid is treated with potassium bromate (KBrO3) in sulfuric acid (H2SO4), maintaining the temperature below 55°C during the addition of KBrO3. The mixture is then warmed to 65°C and stirred for 3.6 hours, producing the cyclic tautomer of 2-iodoxybenzoic acid with a 93% yield. In the second step, a stirred slurry of 2-iodoxybenzoic acid in acetic anhydride and acetic acid is heated to 100°C until the solid dissolves. The solvent is then removed under vacuum at room temperature, resulting in a thick slurry, which is filtered in an inert atmosphere and washed with ether, yielding Periodinane 2 with an 87% overall yield from the iodobenzoic acid.<a href="#fn1" id="ref1-anchor" class="superscript">1</a></p>

### Reagent Facts

<p>DMP is easy to prepare, remains stable under proper storage conditions and is environmentally friendly, producing benign by-products compared to toxic chromium-based oxidizers which often required time-consuming filitration procedures.<a href="#fn1" id="ref1-anchor" class="superscript">1</a></p>

## Tribute to a Great Chemist

<p>James Cullen Martin (1928-1999) was a prominent figure in the field of organic chemistry, known for his pioneering work on hypervalent compounds. Born in Dover, Tennessee, Martin's academic journey began at Vanderbilt University, where he earned both his bachelor's and master's degrees. He continued his education at Harvard University, earning a Ph.D. under the mentorship of Paul Bartlett. His career at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) spanned from instructor to professor, eventually leading the Division of Organic Chemistry.<a href="#fn2" id="ref2-anchor" class="superscript">2</a></p>

Martin's contributions to the field are significant, particularly his invention of the Dess-Martin Periodinane (DMP), a key reagent in organic synthesis.

<p>Martin's research focused on the chemistry of hypervalent compounds, exploring new compounds and bonding main group elements. In 1983, along with his doctoral student Daniel Benjamin Dess, he developed DMP, an efficient and selective reagent for the oxidation of alcohols. This invention addressed several limitations of existing methods, offering a straightforward synthesis and mild reaction conditions. The preparation of DMP involved treating 2-iodobenzoic acid with potassium bromate in sulfuric acid, followed by reaction with acetic anhydride and acetic acid, yielding a high-purity product with an 87% overall yield.<a href="#fn1" id="ref1-anchor" class="superscript">1</a></p>

<p>DMP's efficacy lies in its ability to oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones under mild conditions. The oxidation reactions are performed in dichloromethane (DCM) at room temperature, simplifying the process and avoiding the long reaction times and complex workup procedures associated with other methods. DMP is highly selective, particularly for benzylic alcohols, and its use avoids the generation of toxic by-products, making it environmentally friendly. <a href="#fn1" id="ref1-anchor" class="superscript">1</a></p>

<p>Beyond DMP, Martin made significant contributions to the chemistry of hypervalent molecules. He is credited with developing Martin's sulfurane, another valuable reagent in organic synthesis.<a href="#fn3" id="ref3-anchor" class="superscript">3</a></p>
 
<p>His work earned him several prestigious awards, including a Guggenheim fellowship and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Research Prize. Martin's influence extended beyond his research; he served as chair of the Organic Division of the American Chemical Society and was a beloved mentor to many students and colleagues. <a href="#fn2" id="ref2-anchor" class="superscript">2</a></p>

### Personal Life

Martin's personal life was as rich as his professional one. He was born on January 14, 1928, in Dover, Tennessee, and served in the US Army from 1946 to 1950. During his service, he spent time in Kyoto, Japan, as a cultural liaison after World War II. <p>He married June E. Martin, an occupational therapist, and together they had five children.<a href="#fn2" id="ref2-anchor" class="superscript">2</a></p> Known for his gentle and generous character, Martin balanced his demanding career with a strong commitment to his family. <p>His son, Professor Joseph V. Martin, now at Rutgers University, recalls his father's dedication both at home and in his professional life. Martin passed away on April 20, 1999, in Tampa, Florida, but his legacy continues through his family and the countless chemists he inspired.<a href="#fn3" id="ref3-anchor" class="superscript">3</a></p>

    >}}

<p>Martin's publication record is extensive, with 155 reports, including 99 in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS), 22 in the Journal of Organic Chemistry, and 4 in Tetrahedron Letters. His work covered various themes, from anchimerically accelerated bond homolysis to the chemistry of sulfuranes and hypervalent iodine, phosphorus, and silicon compounds. Notable papers include his first publication with D.E. Pearson and J.F. Baxter in the Journal of Organic Chemistry (1952) and subsequent influential works in JACS and other leading journals. <a href="#fn3" id="ref3-anchor" class="superscript">3</a></p>

James Cullen Martin's achievements and contributions to chemistry have left an indelible mark on the scientific community. His development of the Dess-Martin Periodinane revolutionized alcohol oxidation methods and continues to be a staple in laboratories worldwide. Martin's dedication to research and education, combined with his compassionate nature, ensured that his legacy would be remembered for generations to come. As we celebrate his life and work, we honor a scientist whose innovations and mentorship profoundly impacted the field of organic chemistry.

This Waka was prepared and written by the author for the ISOCS-21 Conference in Madrid in July 2004, in memory of Professor James C. Martin. A Waka is a traditional Japanese short poem consisting of 31 phonetic characters. This is based on a well-known Waka in the Man'yōshū, the oldest collection of Waka, which is supported by the Emperor. The Japanese reading is shown in the Romanized form, followed by a translation.

**幸いのいかなる人か諸国の化学者集い千家悲しむ**<br>
Sakiwai no ikanaru hito ka morokuni no kemisuto tudoi sennge kanashimu

**EN Translation**: What a happy and beloved person he was! Hundreds of chemists from many countries gather to mourn him and admire his accomplishments in chemistry.

Rest in Peace,<br>
Dr. J.C Martin
