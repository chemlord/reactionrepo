## Dess-Martin Periodinane

<p>Periodinane 2, also known as Dess-Martin Periodinane (DMP), was originally derived from 2-iodobenzoic acid and exhibited remarkable efficiency and selectivity. It was reported that DMP was soluble in other solvents such as in hexane or ether were deemed sparingly soluble. Additionally, it was deemed very soluble in dichloromethane, chloroform and acetonitrile. Dichloromethane (DCM) was reported as the primary solvent used as stated by Dess & Martin (1983).<a href="#fn1" id="ref1-anchor" class="superscript">1</a></p>

### Reagent Variations

You may see different variations on how DMP is written out. The OAc group (Acetoxy) is a functional group you've seen before. The two Dess-Martin Periodinane structures depicted here are the same compound, shown in different notations and with varying ring structures.

#### Acetoxy Group vs Acetate Ion

##### Why Compare Acetate Ion vs. Acetoxy Group?

Understanding the distinction between the acetate ion and the acetoxy group is crucial in grasping the chemical behavior and reactivity of molecules like DMP. While the acetoxy group is part of the structure of DMP, it becomes an acetate ion upon leaving the molecule during the oxidation reaction, playing the as role as a good leaving group to become a stable, negatively charged ion.

##### Comparison

{{<figure-dynamic-toggle
    dark-src="PURP2.png"
    light-src="whygod.png"
    title="Differences Between Acetoxy Group and Acetate Ion"
    caption="Here are the essential distinctions to understand."
>}}

**Acetoxy Group (OAc)**:

- **Definition**: The OAc group (acetoxy) is a familiar functional group consisting of an acetyl group (CH‚ÇÉCO) bonded to an oxygen atom.
- **Role in DMP**: In DMP, three acetoxy groups are bonded to the central iodine atom, making them part of the larger molecule.
- **Example Notation**: R-OAc, where R represents the rest of the DMP molecule.

**Acetate Ion (CH‚ÇÉCOO‚Åª)**:

- **Definition**: The acetate ion is a charged particle with a negative electrical charge, formed when an acetoxy group is expelled and loses a hydrogen atom.
- **Formation**: In reactions, when the OAc group is expelled from DMP, it becomes an acetate ion (CH‚ÇÉCOO‚Åª), carrying a negative charge as it takes an extra electron pair.

### Reagent Preparation

The preparation of Dess-Martin Periodinane (DMP) involves two key steps:

<p>First, 2-iodobenzoic acid is treated with potassium bromate (KBrO<sub>3</sub>) in sulfuric acid (H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>), maintaining the temperature below 55¬∞C during the addition of KBrO<sub>3</sub>. The mixture is then warmed to 65¬∞C and stirred for 3.6 hours, producing the cyclic tautomer of 2-iodoxybenzoic acid with a 93% yield.<a href="#fn1" id="ref1-anchor" class="superscript">1</a></p>

<p>In the second step, a stirred slurry of 2-iodoxybenzoic acid in acetic anhydride and acetic acid is heated to 100¬∞C until the solid dissolves. The solvent is then removed under vacuum at room temperature, resulting in a thick slurry, which is filtered in an inert atmosphere and washed with ether, yielding Periodinane 2 with an 87% overall yield from the iodobenzoic acid.<a href="#fn1" id="ref1-anchor" class="superscript">1</a></p>

### Reagent Facts

<p>DMP is easy to prepare, remains stable under proper storage conditions and is environmentally friendly, producing benign by-products compared to toxic chromium-based oxidizers which often required time-consuming filitration procedures.<a href="#fn1" id="ref1-anchor" class="superscript">1</a></p>

    light-src="image3.png"
    title="Photo taken at the author‚Äôs office in Hiroshima and that of J.C. Martin Symposium at Vanderbilt reported in C & EN News."

    >}}

<p>James Cullen Martin (1928-1999) was a prominent figure in the field of organic chemistry, known for his pioneering work on hypervalent compounds. Born in Dover, Tennessee, Martin's academic journey began at Vanderbilt University, where he earned both his bachelor's and master's degrees. He continued his education at Harvard University, earning a Ph.D. under the mentorship of Paul Bartlett. His career at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) spanned from instructor to professor, eventually leading the Division of Organic Chemistry.<a href="#fn4" id="ref4-anchor" class="superscript">4</a></p>

Martin's contributions to the field are significant, particularly his invention of the Dess-Martin Periodinane (DMP), a key reagent in organic synthesis.

<p>Martin's research focused on the chemistry of hypervalent compounds, exploring new compounds and bonding main group elements. In 1983, along with his doctoral student Daniel Benjamin Dess, he developed DMP, an efficient and selective reagent for the oxidation of alcohols. This invention addressed several limitations of existing methods, offering a straightforward synthesis and mild reaction conditions. The preparation of DMP involved treating 2-iodobenzoic acid with potassium bromate in sulfuric acid, followed by reaction with acetic anhydride and acetic acid, yielding a high-purity product with an 87% overall yield.<a href="#fn1" id="ref1-anchor" class="superscript">1</a></p>

<p>DMP's efficacy lies in its ability to oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones under mild conditions. The oxidation reactions are performed in dichloromethane (DCM) at room temperature, simplifying the process and avoiding the long reaction times and complex workup procedures associated with other methods. DMP is highly selective, particularly for benzylic alcohols, and its use avoids the generation of toxic by-products, making it environmentally friendly. <a href="#fn1" id="ref1-anchor" class="superscript">1</a></p>

<p>Beyond DMP, Martin made significant contributions to the chemistry of hypervalent molecules. He is credited with developing Martin's sulfurane, another valuable reagent in organic synthesis.<a href="#fn5" id="ref5-anchor" class="superscript">5</a></p>
 
<p>His work earned him several prestigious awards, including a Guggenheim fellowship and the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation Research Prize. Martin's influence extended beyond his research; he served as chair of the Organic Division of the American Chemical Society and was a beloved mentor to many students and colleagues. <a href="#fn4" id="ref4-anchor" class="superscript">4</a></p>

### Personal Life

<p>Martin's personal life was as rich as his professional one. He was born on January 14, 1928, in Dover, Tennessee, and served in the US Army from 1946 to 1950. During his service, he spent time in Kyoto, Japan, as a cultural liaison after World War II. 

<p>Known for his gentle and generous character, Martin balanced his demanding career with a strong commitment to his family. He married June E. Martin, an occupational therapist, and together they had five children.<a href="#fn5" id="ref5-anchor" class="superscript">5</a></p>

 <p>His son, Professor Joseph V. Martin, now at Rutgers University, recalls his father's dedication both at home and in his professional life. Martin passed away on April 20, 1999, in Tampa, Florida, but his legacy continues through his family and the countless chemists he inspired.<a href="#fn5" id="ref5-anchor" class="superscript">5</a></p>

    >}}

<p>Martin's publication record is extensive, with 155 reports, including 99 in the Journal of the American Chemical Society (JACS), 22 in the Journal of Organic Chemistry, and 4 in Tetrahedron Letters. His work covered various themes, from anchimerically accelerated bond homolysis to the chemistry of sulfuranes and hypervalent iodine, phosphorus, and silicon compounds. Notable papers include his first publication with D.E. Pearson and J.F. Baxter in the Journal of Organic Chemistry (1952) and subsequent influential works in JACS and other leading journals.<a href="#fn5" id="ref5-anchor" class="superscript">5</a></p>

James Cullen Martin's achievements and contributions to chemistry have left an indelible mark on the scientific community. His development of the Dess-Martin Periodinane revolutionized alcohol oxidation methods and continues to be a staple in laboratories worldwide. Martin's dedication to research and education, combined with his compassionate nature, ensured that his legacy would be remembered for generations to come. As we celebrate his life and work, we honor a scientist whose innovations and mentorship profoundly impacted the field of organic chemistry.

This is based on a well-known Waka in the Man'y≈çsh≈´, the oldest collection of Waka, which is supported by the Emperor. The Japanese reading is shown in the Romanized form, followed by a translation.
