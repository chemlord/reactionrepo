<p>The Corey-Schmidt oxidation is a method used to oxidize primary alcohols to aldehydes and secondary alcohols to ketones using the pyridinium dichromate (PDC), also known as the Cornforth reagent. PDC is a salt soluble in halogenated organic solvents such as DCM which allows anhydrous reaction. It reacts similar to PCC and is more suited for acid sensitive compounds.<a href="#fn1" id="ref1-anchor" class="superscript">1</a></p>
