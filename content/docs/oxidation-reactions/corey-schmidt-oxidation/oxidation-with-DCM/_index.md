These are the 3 main types of alcohols: **Primary**, **Secondary** and **Tertiary**.

{{% callout type="warning" %}}
Tertiary alcohols **cannot** go through Corey-Schmidt oxidation.
{{% /callout %}}

- Primary alcohols can go through Corey-Schmidt Oxidation to become an **Aldehyde**.

##### Guide to Side Chains

1. **Assign the Side Chain (R)**: Identify the non-alcohol part of the molecule and assign it as the placeholder 'R' or side chain.

2. **Understand Its Role**: This placeholder helps track the unchanged part of the molecule, aiding in visualizing the structure before and after the reaction.

3. **Focus on the Reaction Center**: The primary alcohol is selectively oxidized to form an aldehyde. The placeholder shows how the structure is altered.

4. **Reassign the Side Chain**: After the reaction, reattach the placeholder R to the new aldehyde, demonstrating the unchanged nature of the side chain.

### Reactive Intermediate Formation

    title="Formation of Reactive Intermediate"
    caption="Alcohol group (-OH) performs a nucleophilic attack on the chromium center of Pyridinium dichromate molecule, forming a complex with the chromium."
>}}

In the first step of the PDC oxidation process, the alcohol group (-OH) attacks the chromium center of the PDC molecule, forming a chromium-alcohol complex. This intermediate is essential for the subsequent oxidation of the alcohol to a carbonyl compound.

### Protonation of Newly Formed Intermediate

<br>

{{<figure-dynamic-toggle
    dark-src="pdcmechdarks2.png" 
    light-src="pdcmechlight2.png"
    title="Subsequent Protonation"
    caption="The newly formed intermediate is protonated to set up the intermediate for further atom rearrangement."
>}}

In this step, the newly formed chromium-alcohol complex undergoes protonation. This protonation stabilizes the intermediate, preparing it for further rearrangement and facilitating the subsequent steps in the oxidation process.

### Atom Rearrangement and Elimination

{{<figure-dynamic-toggle

    light-src="pdcmechlight3.png"
    title="Atom rearrangement and subequent elimination of chromic acid derivative"
    caption="Subsequent protonation leads to atom rearrangement along with the elimination of chromic acid derivative."
>}}

Following protonation, the intermediate undergoes atom rearrangement, leading to the elimination of a chromic acid derivative. This rearrangement facilitates the formation of the final oxidized product, effectively removing the chromium species and advancing the oxidation process to completion.

### Product Formation

The overall products of the Corey Schmidt oxidation include the Aldehyde formed from the secondary alcohol and Chromic Acid as a by-product.

## Mechanism for 2° Alcohol
{{< hextra/hero-subtitle >}}
  This section is a brief overview on how to perform the mechanism for a 2° Alcohol (Secondary) using the example from above.
{{< /hextra/hero-subtitle >}}

{{% steps %}}

### Reactive Intermediate Formation

{{<figure-dynamic-toggle
    dark-src="step1dark.png" 
    light-src="step1light.png"
    title="Formation of Reactive Intermediate for a Secondary Alcohol"
    caption="Alcohol group (-OH) performs a nucleophilic attack on the chromium center of Pyridinium dichromate molecule, forming a complex with the chromium."
>}}

In the first step of the PDC oxidation process, similar to the primary alcohol oxidation mechanism, the alcohol group (-OH) attacks the chromium center of the PDC molecule, forming a chromium-alcohol complex. This intermediate is essential for the subsequent oxidation of the alcohol to a carbonyl compound.

### Protonation of Newly Formed Intermediate

{{<figure-dynamic-toggle
    dark-src="step2dark.png" 
    light-src="step2light.png"
    title="Subsequent Protonation"
    caption="The newly formed intermediate is protonated to set up the intermediate for further atom rearrangement."
>}}

In this step, the newly formed chromium-alcohol complex undergoes protonation. This step is identical to the primary alcohol oxidation steps, except an additional side chain is added. This protonation stabilizes the intermediate, preparing it for further rearrangement and facilitating the subsequent steps in the oxidation process.

### Atom Rearrangement and Elimination

{{<figure-dynamic-toggle
    dark-src="step3dark.png" 
    light-src="step3light.png"
    title="Atom rearrangement and subequent elimination of chromic acid derivative"
    caption="Subsequent protonation leads to atom rearrangement along with the elimination of chromic acid derivative."
>}}

Following protonation, the intermediate undergoes atom rearrangement, leading to the elimination of a chromic acid derivative. This rearrangement facilitates the formation of the final oxidized product, effectively removing the chromium species and advancing the oxidation process to completion. This step is identical to the primary alcohol oxidation.

### Final Overall Products

    title="Ketone product is formed after proton transfer and cleavage of oxide atom"

The overall products of the Corey Schmidt oxidation include the Ketone formed from the secondary alcohol and Chromic Acid as a by-product.
