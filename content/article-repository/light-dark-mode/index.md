## What's the Problem?

In academic settings, particularly in organic chemistry, lecture notes are typically provided in light mode. This default setting may not suit all students, especially those who study at night and could benefit from a less glaring, dark mode option. However, professors <mark>often hestitate to offer</mark> such alternatives due to several challenges:

1. **Lack of Awareness:** Many educators are not fully aware of the benefits that dark mode can offer, such as <mark>reduced eye strain</mark> and improved <mark>readability in low-light conditions</mark> as many students study in the night.
2. **Technical Constraints:** Adapting materials to include mode switching can be limited by the functionalities of commonly used software.
3. **Consistency and Resource Constraints:** Professors may prioritize uniformity in course materials and might view maintaining multiple versions of documents as an unnecessary strain on limited resources.
4. **Underestimation of Benefits:** The potential impact of presentation modes on <mark>learning efficiency</mark> and <mark>visual comfort</mark> may be <mark>underestimated</mark>.

## What's the Solution?

Integrating tools like **ChemDraw**, which supports <mark>colour customization</mark> and mode toggling, can address these issues. **ChemDraw** enhances the <mark>visual appeal</mark> and <mark>readability of material</mark> under various lighting conditions, improving <mark>student engagement</mark> and <mark>learning experiences</mark>. By allowing educators to easily switch between **light and dark modes**, **ChemDraw** offers a practical solution to meet <mark>diverse student needs and preferences</mark>.

## Innovation and Ease of Production

The integration of both **light and dark modes** in educational materials is a <mark>significant innovation</mark> for several reasons:

1. **Increased Accessibility:** By offering both light and dark modes, educational materials cater to a wider range of student preferences and needs. This feature is <mark>particularly beneficial</mark> for those who experience eye strain or who study in low-light conditions, thus enhancing accessibility and comfort.
2. **Novelty Across Departments:** The absence of this practice across various academic departments highlights its <mark>novelty and originality</mark>. Many professors do not implement **mode toggling** due to a combination of factors such as <mark>lack of awareness</mark>, <mark>perceived complexity</mark>, or <mark>limitations</mark> in technical capabilities and software tools.
3. **Ease of Implementation:** With modern software like **ChemDraw**, changing the color settings of a document is <mark>straightforward</mark>. When creating chemical mechanisms or any detailed diagrams, educators can easily adjust the <mark>document settings > Background colour and Foreground colour (Bond Lines)</mark>. This process involves simple modifications in the software settings, making it an <mark>efficient solution without the need for extensive technical knowledge or resources</mark>.
4. **Eye Catching Colours:** Important for catching the <mark>attention</mark> of students and highlighting <mark>important concepts</mark>.

Implementing dual mode options in academic materials is not just a matter of **convenience**; it's a proactive approach to <mark>educational inclusivity</mark>. This method acknowledges <mark>diverse student working conditions and preferences</mark>, **setting a precendent for future educational practices**.
